Clone repository found at [github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/FragranceFinder](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/FragranceFinder) ### Install Dependencies 3. Open 2 separate terminals. One for the backend folder of the project, and one for the frontend folder of the project. 4. In each folder, run `npm i` to install respective dependencies. The backend and frontend both have their own dependenices. Information on these dependencies is found in their associated `package.json` files. ### Load DB Schema 5. Run `npm run load-db-local` in the backend folder to load the database schema into MySQL `fragrance_finder_db` database. ### Start servers 6. In the backend folder, run `npm run start` 7. Now, in the frontend folder, run `npm run start`. This should open a browser window at http://localhost:3000. This is the location of the frontend. If the frontend says \"TEST API ENDPOINT SUCCESS\", this means your frontend is correctly interacting with the backend API.",
