# Sprint 3
 Faithful Odoi,BigFaith, Fragrance Finder

### What you planned to do
- Scrape fragrance data (brand, title, concentration, size, price, gender, image link, and link to the page) purfumeonline.ca [#58](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/FragranceFinder/issues/58)

### What you did not do
- I was able to accomplish all of my tasks

### What problems you encountered
-Poor comunication on my part lead to me making a redundant webscraper

### Issues you worked on
[#58](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/FragranceFinder/issues/58)onlineca scrapper
### Files you worked on
- onlineca.py(FragranceFinder/backend/scrapers/onlineca.py)
### What you accomplished
I accomplished scraping the data for the men's and women's catalogs of products on fragranceonline.ca. To do this, I had the program open up the
respective catalog pages, then scrape the data from the individual product pages. This looped until the final product on the final page of the catalog was scrapped.
When I was done scraping, I had to format the data. I have yet to format the data due to a communication error
