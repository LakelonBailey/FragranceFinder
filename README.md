# Fragrance Finder
## Setup
1. Clone repository at git@github.com:utk-cs340-fall23/FragranceFinder.git
2. Open 2 separate terminals. One for the backend folder of the project, and one for the frontend folder of the project.
3. In each folder, run `npm i` to install respective dependencies.
4. Then, in the backend folder, run `npm run start`
5. Now, in the frontend folder, run `npm run start`. This should open a browser window at http://localhost:3000. This is the location of the frontend. If the frontend says "TEST API ENDPOINT SUCCESS", this means your frontend is correctly interacting with the backend API.
