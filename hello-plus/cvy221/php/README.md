This my attempt at makeing a login screen. The first thing that you need to do is downloawd xammp. Once it is douwnloaded activate apache and mysqul. Then go into the xammp exetuable and change switch the index.php in the executable with the one that is in this directory. After that This is still go to local/host and set up the sever by making a new sever, name it test_db and give it 3 colloms. name the collums id users name a password. Then go to 127.0.0.1 very much a work in progress.
