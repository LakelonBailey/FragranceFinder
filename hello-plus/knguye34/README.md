# React multipage handler
I made modifications to the index.js page, which is the page you look at first when openning the website.
The modifications are made in another branch called dev, so check that out, and you can set it up following
Lakelon's instructions in the README. What I did was experimented with links, since we will be linking a lot
of our products and the navigation bar, which will help guide us through different pages (for different features).
