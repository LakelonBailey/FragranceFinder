# Our website :)
## General Info
I made modifications to the index.js page, which is the page you look at first when openning the website.
The modifications are made in another branch called dev, so check that out, and you can set it up following
Lakelon's instructions in the README. What I did was experimented with links, since we will be linking a lot
of our products and the navigation bar, which will help guide us through different pages (for different features).

## My page
Click on the link "Kien Nguyen's Navigation Bar demo" to take you to my page. The navigation bar doesn't work yet, 
but I will make it link to multiple pages that we create in the upcoming weeks. You can also click the link in there
to take you to a fragrance website, which we will use to webscrape some of the data of the products.
