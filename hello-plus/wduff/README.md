# Hello Plus
This project is a website that was built using the React framework.

### To Run
I have been running this using 'npm start' in the terminal. I have heard that 'npm run dev' could also work
to get the site appearing in a browser.

### Interact
To use the internal links on each page, click on the link and then reload the page. This will send you to the 
corresponding page.
