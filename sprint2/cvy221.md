### Files you worked on
- ministryscrap.py(FragranceFinder/backend/scrapers/ministryscrap.py)

### What you accomplished
I accomplished scraping the data for the men's and women's catalogs of products on ministryofscent.py. To do this i made nested for loops that when to each of the brand pages
and scraped all of the product data from each of the brand catalog pages. After this I formated the data. The format of the data was not consisten throught the website but i was able to work 
around that and managed to pull all of the data that I needed.
