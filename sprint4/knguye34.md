# Sprint 4
Kien Nguyen, KienKong, Fragrance Finder

### What you planned to do
- Finishing up databasing fragrancex and make it work in the MasterScript
- Debug and finish everything before presenting

### What you did not do
- Every task was completed

### What problems you encountered
- Fragrancex didn't fully waited for images to load, so some photolink for some products isn't listed
- We did not test the newer added fragrances to our database because we want to make sure we don't break the website with newer bugs

### Files you worked on
- fragrancenet.py (FragranceFinder/backend/scrapers/fragrancenet.py)
- fragrancex.py (FragranceFinder/backend/scrapers/fragrancex.py)
- MasterScript.py (FragranceFinder/backend/scrapers/MasterScript.py)

### What you accomplished
I was able to finally finish up fragrancex to be able to be used in the master script. It runs and the master script was able to output a json
properly. I also fixed up some bugs that made the scrapers not grab some data properly, and this allowed for more fragrances to be grabbed in the
website. We also finished up the presentation on Wednesday, and the website was able to work with the fragrances that we databased.
