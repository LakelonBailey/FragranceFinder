I made a demo using the Playwright and BeautifulSoup tools to webscrape a fragrance price from the website fragrancebuy.ca

The demo opens the page in a new browser, scrapes the price and then closes.
Then price is then outputted to the console. 

In order to run it you must have Playwright and BeautifulSoup installed this can be done with

# Install Playwright
1. pip install playwright
2. playwright install , this will install the browsers that the webscraper will use

# Install BeautifulSoup
3. pip install beautifulsoup4


# Run the Program
The program can be run using 'python pwdemo.py'
or ran using Visual Studio.
