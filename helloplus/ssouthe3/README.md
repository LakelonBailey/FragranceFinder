# React multipage handler
I made modifications to the App.js file in "frontend/src" folder that activated React-Router and added the sub directory "pages" in the same folder that will contain all of our webpages. Before this, Lakelon Bailey had written a database read and write example in App.js which I then moved into it's own webpage and then created index.js in the "pages" sub directory that contains links to each of our team member's hello plus demos. After I had accomplished this, I then moved on to my original goal which was to create the backend code for sending a "hello world" email.

# Email bot hello world
