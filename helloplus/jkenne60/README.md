I was unable to get teammates on the phone to help impliment these product types to the page,
because I was working on this too late. I have just implimented this in the personal folder for
now though. I will work more on implementing this to the actual webpage later on. Follow the 
instructions that Lakelon made to get all of this to run for the other parts of this though.
