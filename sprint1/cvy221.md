# Sprint 1
Faithful Odoi, BigFaith, FragranceFinder

### What you planned to do
- Scrape fragrance data (name, brand, price, gender, link, etc.) on zgofragrance
- work on databasing
### What you did not do
- Still working on diffrentiating some of the descriptor such as gender and concentration
- have not worked on databasing yet

### What problems you encountered
- information on this webstite shares many of the same main names so differentiating some of the data that I need to pull is difficult.
- Format that info is layed out is different for some of the web pages so i need to account for that .
- Computer crashed for whatever reason forcing me to redo a lot of what I had done

### Issues you worked on
- Have managed to successfully scrape lots of the data I need

### Files you worked on
- zgoscrap.py

### What you accomplished
- Had to download many extension such as beautifulsoup, playwright, pip, and requests. With these I was able to step up a redemantary webscraper and have a basic understand on how the are supposed to work.
- Still running to some issues of pulling wrong data or weird errors caused by inncorrect function calls but those are just growing pains from learning something new.
