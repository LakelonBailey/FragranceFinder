# Sprint 1
Kien Nguyen, KienKong, FragranceFinder

### What you planned to do
- Worked with React and NodeJS to create a local webpage and display a demo navigation bar
- Scrape fragrance data (name, brand, price, gender, link, savings, ratings, etc.) on fragrancenet.com
- Displaying the data from the jumbly html format to a nice print format that is easy to see
- Begin databasing the data after collecting it from the website

### What you did not do
- I have not listed the price correctly yet
- I did not database since I am still looking into it (and our group is deciding how we want to do it)

### What problems you encountered
- Because the price is not listed in the default first page (and shows the available sizes instead), 
I have to find a way to go into the product link and extract data from there. The only caveat is that
the website blocks that from happening, so I have to figure my way around to get the pricing.
- I want to make it to apply to multiple websites, but because most websites are formatted differently,
it makes it tough to have 1 program work for many websites.

### Issues you worked on
- I have not worked on the issue with the pricing yet, so I will post that into the github issue section.

### Files you worked on
- fragrancenet.py (backend/scrapers/fragrancenet.py)
- navbar.css (frontend/src/pages/CSS/navbar.css)
- navigation.js (frontend/src/pages/demos/navigation.js)
- index.js (frontend/src/pages/demos/index.js)

### What you accomplished
- I was able to get a local webpage working (Thank you Lakelon) and demo a simple navigation bar
- I can webscrape a decent amount of data from fragrancenet and display it in a more user-friendly format
